# Last.fm Analyzer
A hopefully simple tool to let you analyze your scrobbles to your hearts
content. Last.fm has some analysis itself, but it's fairly basic and mostly
limited to the previous calendar year.

## Background
This is the final project for a university class - database systems. The main
goal is to implement a SQL database, but I would like to do some fun analysis on
my Last.fm library anyway.
